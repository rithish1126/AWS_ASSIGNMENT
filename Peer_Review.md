#Arin's Approach
## Task 1
1)For the first question arin has also used awscli and instead of attaching the role to the instance created to run it , arin uses the assume command to run the instance
## Task 2
2)Arin has also given some basic permissions to a role to run the lamda function, then has attached a cloudwatch trigger with a rule to run the python script thrice and then proceeded to get the cloudwatch logs as three files were being uploaded to the s3 bucket
## Task 3
3)For the third task arin has also used the lamda function and has added api triggers and has made api methods to take input and send requests and has tested it using Postman
